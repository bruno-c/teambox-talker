- How to handle big messages like pastes? (server could POST to our private paste web service and broadcast link to room instead of full message)
- Delete user queue if unused for 30-60 sec (can RabbitMQ handle that?)
- Test case of the same user connecting to the same room twice
- Improve perf by making partial messages transient (see High-speed transient message flows on http://www.rabbitmq.com/faq.html#scenarios)
