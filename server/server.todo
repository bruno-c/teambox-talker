- Delete user queue if unused for 30-60 sec (can RabbitMQ handle that?)
- Test case of the same user connecting to the same room twice
- Improve perf by making partial messages transient (see High-speed transient message flows on http://www.rabbitmq.com/faq.html#scenarios)
✓ Handle timeout of clients
✓ Send list of online users when new user connects
✓ Log message history
✓ Support clustering / redundancy (handled by AMQP)
✓ Resend possibly lost messages on reconnect (handled by AMQP)
