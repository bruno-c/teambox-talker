note: previously, the default morphology for indexing was 'stem_en'. The new
default is nil, to avoid any unexpected behavior. If you wish to keep the old
value though, you will need to add the following settings to your
config/sphinx.yml file:

development:
  morphology: stem_en
test:
  morphology: stem_en
production:
  morphology: stem_en
