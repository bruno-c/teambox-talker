Talker Server:
- Expire connections (on presence server) if user leaves while channel server is down
âœ“ Support delta indexing of events

Chef:
- Tweaks mysql recipe (use the one from opscode?); using too much mem
- Move /db to /mnt or mount EBS volume
- Server and room behind SSL (maybe can have nginx do all that)
- Put talker servers behind haproxy
- Have a fallback or multiple logger and presence instances running
- Implement Zero downtime thing, see http://www.igvita.com/2008/12/02/zero-downtime-restarts-with-haproxy/
